The ethos of Roosevelt’s New Deal produced a whole series of collaborations between writers, photographers, artists, composers, choreographers and ethnologists, encouraged and funded to portray the lives of everyday American life in all its regions and cultures. The article eventually led to a book which was published in 1941, <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em>, now regarded as one of the great books of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. In his introduction, Agee wrote quite specifically on the relationship between the words and the images: ‘The photographs are not illustrative. They, and the text, are coequal, mutually independent, fully collaborative.’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The subject of how writers and photographers work together is, not surprisingly, something which deeply interests us. When Jason and I started working together in 2005, the relationship began, necessarily, as a matter of trust. After nearly ten years of collaboration, clearer understandings as to how we see our different roles have emerged, partly helped by reading and talking about other people’s work. Apart from the Agee/Walker collaboration, both of us admire the work of John Berger and Jean Mohr. Of his experience of the relationship between words and photographs, Berger once wrote:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">‘And so they work together, the written lines and the pictures, and they never say the same thing. They don’t know the same things, and that is the secret of living together. The photos are a reminder of everything which is beyond the power of words…and the words recall what can never be made visible in any photographs.’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">These are our sentiments entirely, and although we have spent a lot of time together, walking and talking, we soon realised that the practicalities of our different roles involve entirely distinct working practices. Rarely are any photographs taken or extensive notes made on our joint forays into the suburbs and countryside, which are principally exercises in immersion rather than documentation. If Jason becomes interested in a place he returns again (and often again and again), waiting for a particular light. Photography is required to be done out in the field, <em>in situ</em>, whereas the writing is invariably done back at home in London, with visits to the British Library or Essex Record Office if there is a need to check historical or topographical facts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The photographs are immediately almost inviolable: shot on film rather than digital, there is minimal manipulation or adaptation afterwards. Editing largely involves selecting the strongest and most appropriate photographs &#8211; not manipulating them to make them fit. By contrast, the writing process involves endlessly adapting and changing the text right up to the moment of publication, attempting to get the right words in the right order. In a way the photographs come into being fully composed, whereas the text is provisional until solidified in print, and design adds a fuurther element in the overall ‘balance of power’.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was clear when we first started working together that Jason and I broadly shared the same understanding of why landscape matters, an understanding that has been developed and enriched over time. In an interview with Jason in Creative Review, shortly after the publication of <em>The New English Landscape</em>, he said that:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">‘I still believe that photography, and particularly landscape photography, has an important role in establishing concrete knowledge about a particular place. I am interested in what people value within a landscape, the ways they connect with the landscape around them, and how photography can explore the relationship between landscape, history and meaning.&#8217;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">These comments echo something Roland Barthes wrote in <em>Camera Lucida</em> about landscape photography, which was that such photographs ‘must be <em>habitable</em>, not visitable.’ Representing how a place has been inhabited – and is inhabited again through words and images – is what we try to do. Barthes also famously described photography as capturing a moment which has now passed and can never be recovered again &#8211; as such a photograph is like a <em>memento mori</em>. It could be that the dynamic achieved &#8211; through the juxtaposition of words and photographs &#8211; arises from the fact that while writing appears to bring people and places back to life again, photography is about recording landscapes and settlements before they disappear. Through this chemistry of word and image, absence and presence are conjured into being.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There is more to discuss on this matter, clearly, and other people’s thoughts are welcome.</p>\n<p> KW</p>\n",

	"content": "<p>Dear Gov. Walker,</p>\n<p>Last week, you told professors at the University of Wisconsin that they needed to &#8220;work harder.&#8221; You were making a case that the Wisconsin state budget crisis could be ameliorated by increasing employee efficiency, and you suggested having faculty teach at least one more class. I&#8217;m not going to talk about whether or not the budget crisis is manufactured (some have argued it could be solved by <a href=\"http://badgerherald.com/opinion/2013/04/24/walker-foolishly-rej/\">accepting federal funds for the state&#8217;s Badger Care health program</a>), or whether your real goal is really partisan politics, and not fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1192\" style=\"width: 373px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://contemplativemammoth.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10943661_10152718197408108_3188838062368218389_o.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1192\" src=\"https://contemplativemammoth.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10943661_10152718197408108_3188838062368218389_o.jpg?w=363&#038;h=484\" alt=\"Ouch. \" width=\"363\" height=\"484\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ouch. Photo by fellow UW Madison geographer Sigrid Peterson.</p></div>\n<p>Instead, I want to talk about the myth of the lazy professor, a stereotype that you&#8217;ve reinforced with your comment. I spent 2005 to 2012 at the University of Wisconsin, where I obtained a PhD in the Department of Geography; I am now an assistant professor at the University of Maine.</p>\n<p>When you say we should work harder, I hear two things: 1) we aren&#8217;t working hard, and 2) we don&#8217;t think we have to. Professors seem like an easy target. We have good job security, we&#8217;re paid well, we often come from privileged backgrounds. We appear to have little to do but teach a class for a few hours a week, and we have extended vacations. It&#8217;s easy to see us as cloistered in the Ivory Tower, without much experience with the &#8220;real world&#8221; and the concerns of average folks.</p>\n<p>The picture I&#8217;ve painted for you is incomplete, though. First, the diversity of faculty has been increasing slowly, to include women, minorities, the working class, and other historically underrepresented groups. We may be paid well, but we&#8217;re not paid as well as our counterparts in the nonacademic positions, and getting a PhD comes with many opportunity costs (at 34, I have only just started a retirement fund and saving for a home). For me, as a working class, first-generation college student, a PhD and an academic career was a pathway to the middle class.</p>\n<p>A faculty career is much more than a couple of leisurely hours pontificating in the classroom. I put in 50 to 60 hours of work a week at a minimum, and only 6 of those are in the classroom. So what about the rest?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teaching preparation: It can take hours to prepare each lecture, including research, reading, and preparing slides and notes. Then, there&#8217;s grading, office hours to meet with students, and the undergraduate majors I advise. Total, this takes an average of 15 hours a week.</li>\n<li>Meetings: I meet with my graduate advisees for an hour each, plus our weekly lab meetings. I have faculty meetings (where we try to decide things like how to run the department with the most undergraduate majors on campus in the face of drastic budget cuts). I have university-level committee work (faculty do a lot of administrative work to help the university function). I&#8217;m on a search committee this semester to hire a new professor to replace one who passed away unexpectedly. I attend presentations by visiting scholars and students, and committee meetings for the students I advise. Total, meetings can average 10 hours a week.</li>\n<li>Research: I go into the field or the lab when I can but most of my time these days is spent on proposals (which have a 6% success rate, and which bring in money to the university in the form of 46% overhead). Writing papers takes a lot of time: analysis, writing, revision, making figures, submission to a journal, and revision. I try to save at least 10 hours a week for research even in busy weeks, but I don&#8217;t always succeed. When I have a grant deadline, this can take 20-60 hours a week.</li>\n<li>Service &amp; Outreach: I review papers and grant proposals in my discipline and am an editor for two journals (an unpaid service). I am on the board of an international scientific society. I co-run the department seminar program, where we bring scholars from all over the world to interact with our scientists and fuel collaboration and innovation. I give talks at other universities (typically unpaid), and I am a resource for journalists and general inquiries from the community. I blog and use Twitter. I host school children in my lab and Skype with classrooms and give public lectures. None of this is in my job description, but I do it because communicating my work is important to me, and because as a faculty at a public land grant institution doing publicly funded work, I believe I have a duty to do so. This can take as much as 5-10 hours a week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All told, this adds to at least 50 to 60 hours a week, on average, year-round. I don&#8217;t get summers off. I may not get paid for my work in the summer, but operations don&#8217;t cease in my lab or my office. Summer is a time to push forward research, to get into the field and collect new data, and to take advantage of the lack of meetings and classes to get work done. I think my situation is pretty typical, compared with my colleagues&#8217; work loads in the sciences (my friends in the humanities often have much heavier teaching loads, though grant-writing and research expectations may be reduced in contrast).</p>\n<p>So, Governor, when you say &#8220;work harder,&#8221; I want to know if you&#8217;re really asking me to add another 15-20 hours to my week? If not, where do I make the cuts? Which of the above can I stop doing without doing a major disservice to my department, my university, my students, or my field? Or, I could do the same amount of work, but put less effort into teaching, and pass those cuts along to the students taking my classes, and the parents investing in their kids&#8217; educations.</p>\n<p>When you tell us to &#8220;work harder,&#8221; you paint a false picture of academic labor and its value. The University of Wisconsin has a rich legacy of teaching, research, and service to the state, the nation, and the world; this is the institution that has made immense advancements in nutrition (including discoveries of vitamins A and B, methods for fortification of milk with vitamin D and iodization that have saved thousands of lives), that pioneered the field of meteorology, made major advancements in the study of what causes and cures cancer, that conducted the nation&#8217;s first bone marrow transplant, discovered retroviruses, developed the map projection used by National Geographic, and cultured the first embryonic stem cells.</p>\n<p>These innovations came about not by random chance or lone genius, but by work. Hard work.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter, ultimately, whether the myth of the lazy professor is born of anti-intellectualism, political grandstanding, or ignorance. It belittles the efforts of people working to save lives, develop new technologies, protect our natural resources, create works of beauty for others to enjoy, and understand the forces that have shaped our past and our present. It diminishes our legacy, and promotes policies that will undermine our ability to innovate, adapt, create, and understand our world.</p>\n<p>I invite you to consider shadowing a professor for a week. I&#8217;m sure there are any number of folks who would be willing to share their labor with you, so that you understand the full extent of what hard work looks like through our eyes. My office door is always open should you find yourself in Maine.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Dr. Jacquelyn Gill<br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin &#8217;08 (MS), &#8217;12 (PhD)</p>\n<p>PS I wrote this letter in my &#8220;free time.&#8221;</p>\n",
